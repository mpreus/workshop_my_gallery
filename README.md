# workshop_my_gallery
Simple gallery of my photos made for mindful people
It's a single page internet site with several photos taken and developed by the author.
The humble project was developed with a little help of Wes Bos tutorial within his 30-day JavaScript challenge.
Its main aim is to improve and demonstrate my JavaScript (including ES6) skills.

How it works:
Clicking on any word opens the associating picture and enables the user to read additional banner. 
The word may be clicked again to close current picture or one may want to click the others words.
Try various combinations of opening and closing pictures.
