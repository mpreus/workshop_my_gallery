# workshop_my_gallery
Simple gallery of my photos made for mindful people.
It's a single page internet site with several photos which I have taken and processed on my own.
The humble project was developed with a little help of Wes Bos tutorial within his 30-day JavaScript challenge.
The main aim of this job is to improve and demonstrate my JavaScript (including ES6) skills.

How it works:
Clicking on any word opens the associating picture and enables the user to read additional banner. 
The word may be clicked again to close current picture or one may want to click the others words.
Try various combinations of opening and closing pictures.
